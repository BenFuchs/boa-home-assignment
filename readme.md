BOAIDEAS home task - Benayah Fuchs

The task given to me was to create a checkout extension in a shopify store that would allow logged in users to save and retrieve their carts from an external database.
I had run into some problems throughout this task, mainly with the proxy server configuration and the ability to access the shopify backend API.
In order to turn in a semi-working result, i had decided to set up my own node express server (see backend folder in the src) and raise it with an ngrok proxy so that it would be able to communicate with the frontend.

Although this result is far from the requested and far from my own liking, it is what i could achieve given the time constraints given to me. I will continue to work on this project to learn more both about the Shopify development and about the skills i had lacked in order to solve this in a more efficient way.

currently there is a working save/retireve/delete function that connects to an active MySQL server i had served on a docker container.
I appreciate this assignment as it has shown me i have still much to learn, and aa lot of room to grow as a programmer.
